# third_party Directory

This folder records external assets that influence the Windows build. No source archives are committed in this iteration; see `inventory.yml` for provenance and licensing.

To update:

1. Pull the desired commit/tag.
2. Record metadata in `inventory.yml`.
3. Add a README inside the vendored asset directory summarizing scope and upstream URL.

# SINE Editor - Isochronic Tone Graph Editor

## Overview

The SINE Editor is a powerful tool for creating isochronic tone presets with precise control over entrainment frequency, carrier frequency, and volume over time. Unlike the segment-based Timeline Editor, the SINE Editor provides a graph-based interface for creating smooth, continuous frequency transitions.

## Key Features

### Graph-Based Editing
- **Control Points**: Create precise curves by adding and adjusting control points
- **Visual Timeline**: See your entire session visualized with frequency, volume, and carrier frequency graphs
- **Time-Based Editing**: Fine-tune parameters at specific times in your session

### Parameter Control
- **Entrainment Frequency**: Control the brain entrainment frequency (0.5-40Hz) 
- **Base Frequency**: Adjust the carrier wave frequency (20-1000Hz)
- **Volume Control**: Set volume levels throughout your session

### Export Options
- **Save Presets**: Save your designs as .sin files to reuse later
- **Export Audio**: Generate high-quality WAV, FLAC, or MP3 files
- **Video Processing**: Use your SINE presets with the IsoFlicker video processor

## Using the SINE Editor

### Creating a New Preset
1. Launch the SINE Editor using the startup script (option 2)
2. Click "File" > "New" to create a new preset
3. Give your preset a name when prompted

### Editing Curves
1. Click on a graph to add control points
2. Drag control points to adjust time and value
3. Right-click on a point to delete it
4. The values and time position of selected points are displayed on the graph

### Typical Workflow
1. Create an entrainment frequency curve that transitions between desired brainwave states
2. Adjust the base frequency curve to modify the tone quality
3. Fine-tune the volume curve if needed
4. Save your preset for later use or export as audio

### Using Presets with Videos
1. Start IsoFlicker Pro (option 1 in the startup script)
2. Select your video in the Basic Mode tab
3. Click "Process Video with SINE Preset"
4. Select your .sin file when prompted
5. Configure the processing options and export your video

## Brainwave Frequency Guide

- **Gamma**: 30-40Hz - Peak concentration, heightened perception
- **Beta**: 13-30Hz - Active, alert thinking
- **Alpha**: 8-12Hz - Relaxed awareness, light meditation
- **Theta**: 4-7Hz - Deep meditation, drowsiness
- **Delta**: 0.5-4Hz - Deep sleep, healing

## Tips for Creating Effective Presets

- **Start High, Go Low**: Begin with higher frequencies (Beta) and gradually transition to target frequencies
- **Smooth Transitions**: Use multiple control points to create gradual, gentle transitions
- **Base Frequency**: Higher base frequencies (300-500Hz) are often perceived as clearer
- **Session Duration**: Allow 5-10 minutes per brainwave state for effective entrainment

Remember that brainwave entrainment affects different people in different ways. Start with shorter sessions and adjust based on your experience.

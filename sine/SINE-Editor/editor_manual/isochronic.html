        <h2>Brainwave Entrainment and Isochronic tones</h2>
        <h3>Brainwave Entrainment</h3>
        Brainwave Entrainment is the practice of using sounds, visual stimuli or even electromagnetic fields to alter the frequency of brainwaves.<br/>
        It can be done for several reasons: people with insomnia can take great benefit from it, but it can also be used to improve your attention span, and even simulate the effects of some recreational drugs.<br/>
        The effect is not in any way permanent, and usually fades away in less than a minute after the stimuli is removed.<br/>
        Commonly used frequencies are: 10Hz (awake), 15-18Hz (focusing on something), 0.5-4Hz (deep sleep), etc. You can find more frequencies on the Internet.<br/>Very rarely do these frequencies go beyond 20Hz. This application supports frequencies up to 40Hz.
        <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
        Brainwave Entrainment is perfectly safe, but if you suffer from epilepsy or a similar condition, you may want to consult your medic before trying it.
        <h3>Does it actually work?</h3>
        People react differently to Brainwave Entrainment: in general, it takes some practice before you can get the desired effect, and for ~15% of the population, it doesn't work at all.<br/>
        If it's your first time using Brainwave Entrainment, you should start with something simple, like sleep-inducing presets, then you can move on to more complicated things like Astral Projections.
        <h3>Isochronic tones</h3>
        Isochronic tones are a commonly used aural stimuli for Brainwave Entrainment. They consist of short pulses of (usually) a sine wave. These pulses can vary in frequency. Their frequency is called Entrainment Frequency, and is the frequency that you want to synchronize your brainwaves to.<br/>
        Other types of aural stimuli are Binaural Beats and Monaural Beats. Isochronic tones are usually much more effective, and can be played through speakers, unlike Binaural Beats which require headphones.
        <h3>Background noise</h3>
        Many people complain about "the static" in the background. Background noise is needed in order for Isochronic tones (as well as Binaural and Monaural Beats) to work: without background noise, your brain "adapts" within a few minutes and you stop hearing the beats, thus nullifying the effects of the Preset.<br/>
        Of course white noise can be very irritating to listen to, so most people use pink or brown noise, which are more delicate. This application uses a custom noise similar to pink noise, but with less high frequencies.

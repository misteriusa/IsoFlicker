        <h2>Sharing</h2>
        On the application's website, we've created a Preset sharing platform, where users can share their work and download other user's Presets.<br/>
        The sharing platform is totally open: anyone can use it without the need of a registration.
        <h3>Test your Preset!</h3>
        Before you share your Preset, you should test it to make sure everything works as intended: please do not upload buggy or pointless Presets.
        <h3>Sharing</h3>
        First, save your Preset. The file name will be visible, so give it a meaningful and short name, for instance: lucid.sin for Lucid dream is fine, but Preset.sin isn't.<br/>
        Now, open the file menu and click share: your browser will open on the sharing platform:
        <div><img src="sharing_1.png"/></div>
        Now, click browse, select the file you want to upload and hit Upload.
        <div><img src="sharing_2.png"/></div>
        The Preset will be checked to see if it's valid, and if everything's fine, it will be shown immediately, otherwise an error will tell you what was wrong with it.<br/>
        Presets shared on this platform must have a title, an author and a description.
        <div><img src="sharing_3.png"/></div>
        As you can see, users can see the description, vote your Preset, share it, and leave comments.
        <h3>Abuse and license</h3>
        We check everything that's uploaded by the users: broken Presets, fake Presets, plagiarized Presets and spam will be removed immediately.<br/>
        We DO NOT collect personal data of any kind through the sharing platform.<br/>
        All the Presets uploaded are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license, unless otherwise specified in the Preset description.

Add practical UI extras (e.g., “Reset Curve,” “Snap to Frequencies”) if it helps improve workflow—but keep it minimal and user-friendly.
2. Text Overlay Feature (Microsecond Timing & Customization)
Provide a text input box to define multiple text overlays, each with:
Start time (allow sub-second or microsecond precision).
Duration (how long it stays visible).
Content (text string).
Opacity (slider from 0% to 100%).
Font style (family/typeface), font size, and color.
Let users add, remove, and reorder text entries in a list (e.g., text #1 from 00:00:15.500 to 00:00:25.000, etc.).
Optimize final output so the processed video isn’t huge; consider a CRF-based approach or similar compression, while keeping good quality.
Accelerate rendering so adding overlays doesn’t drastically slow down processing.
3. Waveform Variety & Protocol Presets
Waveforms: Expand beyond sine to include square, triangle, sawtooth, possibly fractal noise.
Protocol Presets: Provide a small, built-in library of frequency sets for typical goals (e.g., ADHD/beta, Anxiety/alpha, Insomnia/theta–delta). These should be quickly loadable and editable in the SINE Editor.
4. Visual Flicker & Optional Pattern Overlays
Let the user pick flicker wave shapes (square or sine) with duty cycle controls.
Optionally add color cycling or fractal/geometric pattern overlays to enhance the flicker effect.
Keep resource usage (CPU) manageable—use short loops or lower-resolution generation if needed.
5. Advanced Mixing & Spatial Audio
Stereo support: generate separate left/right channels with panning or alternate pulses.
Possibly combine isochronic and binaural elements for advanced stimulation.
Let users import a secondary audio track (background music, nature sounds) with its own volume control.
Include a subliminal masking option (e.g., low-pass filter or near-inaudible volume level) if needed.
6. Performance & Output Optimization
Video file size: keep processed outputs from ballooning in size.
Render speed: ensure the flicker, overlays, and multi-audio merges don’t cause huge slowdowns.
Consider multi-threaded FFmpeg or library calls with a moderate CRF value (like 22–28 for H.264/H.265).
If feasible, let users pick an encoding preset (fast, balanced, high-quality).
Success Criteria:

Restored SINE Editor with simpler UI but improved timeline-based modulation of frequency/amplitude.
Text overlays with microsecond timing, adjustable appearance, and minimal final file size overhead.
Expanded audio waveforms and a small library of ready-to-use frequency protocols for common conditions.
Enhanced visual flicker options plus optional color or fractal pattern overlays.
Stereo/multichannel mixing with panning and a second audio track for background or subliminal use.
Optimized encoding and rendering so the final video is smaller in size and processes faster.
write it in a continous line since i will paste it into a command prompt
